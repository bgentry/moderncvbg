moderncvbg -- a modern curriculum vitae class

Moderncvbg provides a documentclass for typesetting modern curriculum vitaes in
various styles. It is fairly customizable, allowing you to define your own style
by changing the colors, the fonts, ... and provides two default styles: classic
and casual.

The moderncvbg documentclass need it's input to be formatted with regular
commands like:
  \section,
  \subsection,
  \maketitle,
but also defines its own special commands:
  \cventry,
  \firstname,
  \familyname,
  ...
Most commands are defined in such a way that the arguments are optional.

Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.

Until a decent manual is written, you can always look in the "examples"
directory for some examples.
